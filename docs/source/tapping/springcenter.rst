Whatâ€™s a spring center?
===============
A spring center is a tool that helps ensure that threads are straight when you are tapping a hole. You use it by putting it into the spindle of a mill (without turning it on) and locking the quill. The small rod at the end fits onto the handle of the tap drill and keeps the tap drill perpendicular to your part as you manually spin it.
