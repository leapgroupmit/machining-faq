Why are there different types of taps, and how are they different?
================
The **taper tap** is gradual and forgiving, so it is used to start threading a hole. 

The **plug tap** is consistent and is used to thread the majority of the hole. 

The **bottoming tap** is used when you are not threading a through-hole, and it completes the threads.
