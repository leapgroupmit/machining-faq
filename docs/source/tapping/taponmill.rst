How do I set up a tap on the mill? 
=============
There are two ways to tap on the mill. The first involves using the mill to steady the tap, but not using its power. The second involves turning on the mill.

**Method 1:** put the tap in a tap handle/wrench, and put a center in the spindle. Place the handle around the center, and manually turn the wrench ½ turn forward, ¼ back.

**Method 2:** Place the tap in a chuck (not a keyless chuck!), and place the chuck in the mill. Slowly (low RPM) rotate the spindle for a few threads in the forward direction, and then remove the tap by reversing directions. This helps to break chips. Make sure to add oil throughout the process.
