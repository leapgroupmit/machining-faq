How do I set up a tap/die?
==============
To use a tap, place the tap in the handle and place it into the hole you wish to thread. Add lubricant, and 
twist the tap half a turn clockwise and a quarter turn counterclockwise until your desired depth. Turning the
tap in reverse (counterclockwise) helps break chips, which keeps them from jamming and ultimately breaking the 
tap. When removing the tap, make sure to rotate it counterclockwise rather than just pulling straight up-youâ€™d 
mess up the threads! For a demonstration, `watch here.  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVnN4jiB7Gk>`_

To use a die, it helps when the rod that you are threading has a chamfer for ease of use. From then on, the
process is very similar to using a tap. Surround your die of choice with a holding device and using both 
handles, spin a half turn forward and a quarter turn backward until your desired depth.
