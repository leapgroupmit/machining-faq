How do I make the threads go all the way to the bottom of the hole?
============
On blind holes (holes that donâ€™t go all the way through the part), you can use a bottoming tap to finish the threads. On clearance holes (holes that go all the way through the part), you can either use a bottoming tap or continue threading parts until the entire tapered portion has gone through the bottom of the hole.
