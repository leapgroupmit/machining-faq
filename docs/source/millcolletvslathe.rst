What is the difference between the collets used on the mill and those used on the lathe?
======================================================================

Both types of collets physically work the same way. Collets typically have “fingers” and a taper. When we squeeze the outside of the collet, 
these fingers tighten, resulting in high static friction and a strong clamping force.

* On a mill, we use a collet in the spindle to **hold a cutting tool.** There are a few types of mill collets, but you’ll commonly use **R8 collets** on smaller milling machines. R8 collets have **internal threads** that attach to the mill drawbar. When you load a tool into the mill, the drawbar threads into the end of the collet. `Learn more here.<https://youtu.be/zAaw4wBrmlk?t=156>`

  * We can also use a lathe collet (5C collet) inside of a collet block to hold round parts on a mill.

* On a lathe, we use a collet in the spindle to **hold a part.** We often refer to lathe collets as **5C collets.** 5C collets have **external threads** that attach to the lathe drawtube. Pulling back the drawbar pulls the collet into a tapered bore, which presses the collet “fingers” against your piece.
