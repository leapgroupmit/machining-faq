What are the different kinds of files?  And how do I know when to use them?
==============

* **Hand files** are wide and flat and can be used for miscellaneous purposes, like deburring, smoothing edges, and finishing workpieces. 

* **Pillar files** are thin and good for grooves and slots. 

* **Square files** are suited for removing metal to make rectangular holes and slots bigger. 

* **Three square files** (triangular files) are designed to trim down internal angles or make triangular slots. 

* **Precision files,** also called Swiss-pattern files, can come in many shapes and sizes, but they are unified by the fine, x-shaped grooves that cover them. Swiss-pattern files are good for **smoothing out complex or delicate features** that require precision. `Learn more. <https://www.mscdirect.com/basicsof/hand-files>`_
