How do I know if the file is dull?
=============

A file is dull if it starts making the metal rougher instead of smoothly cutting away material.
To solve this, first remove chip buildup from the teeth. If the problem is solved, it was likely 
jammed, not dull. If the problem continues, you can sharpen the file `as such. <https://youtu.be/rRakH7TrE2E>`_
