What is draw filing?
==============

Draw filing involves pushing a flat file back and forth on a piece of metal to make a smooth, flat surface or edge. Hold the file sideways: if the handle is in your right hand, you file on the push strokes and lift on the pull strokes. If the handle is in your left hand, you file on the pull strokes and lift on the push strokes. When draw filing, the weight of the file is enough – you don’t need to put significant pressure on the file!
