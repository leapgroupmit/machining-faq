How do I determine an acceptable depth of cut?
==============
You should not exceed the maximum depth of cut for the device you are using. For square shaped 
inserts, do not exceed ⅔ of the cutting edge length. For other shaped inserts, the maximum depth
of cut ranges from a quarter to a half of the length of the cutting edges. In general, 
you should decide on a consistent value for rough cut-s that is less than 0.100” and a 
smaller value for finishing cuts. Here is a 
`useful resource <https://cadem.com/maximum-depth-of-cut-turning-inserts/>`_
for depth of cut for various lathe tools.
