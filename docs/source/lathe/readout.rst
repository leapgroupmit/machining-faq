What are the different read out options?
===========
* Incidental vs. absolute: 
  
  * Coordinates are **absolute** when they stay the same throughout all operations. A fixed zero is set and all measurements are with reference to that point.
  
  * Coordinates are **incidental** when they vary based on each previous operation. Each time you move to a new location on the part, it becomes the new reference point for further operations.

* Radius vs. diameter

  * **Radius** mode shows a direct relationship between how much you are moving the tool and the measurement on the DRO. If you move the tool 0.001” in, the DRO will read 0.001”.
  
  * **Diameter** mode shows how much material is actually being cut, which is double the radius mode. Thus, if you move the tool 0.001” in, the workpiece’s diameter decreases by 0.002”, and the DRO will read 0.002”.
