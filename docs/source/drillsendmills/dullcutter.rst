How do I know when my cutter is dull?
======================

The following could be indicators that your cutter is dull:

* High resistance trying to cut a piece

* Bad surface finish regardless of speed, feed, or depth of cut

* The tool starts excessively heating up and making noises

Take a look at your cutting tool and see if thereâ€™s any wear or chips along the cutting edges. You may need to replace your cutting tool.
