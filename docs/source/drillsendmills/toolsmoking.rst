Why is the tool smoking?
==================

The tool may be smoking because it is overheating. This could be a result of bad chip formation due to improper speed and feed rates. You may benefit from decreasing the speed and increasing the feed rate, adding lubrication or coolant, and if using an end mill, decreasing the number of flutes. If none of these solutions work, it may be an internal issue with the machine.
