Why choose a two flute end mill vs. a four flute end mill?
=====================

2-flute end mills are used for softer metals, like aluminum, where the RPM can be high and chips can more easily egress. 
4-flute end mills are a thicker beam but with less capacity for chips, so they are used for harder alloys like machining 
steel with slower speeds (low RPM). `Read more here. <https://www.harveyperformance.com/in-the-loupe/flute-count-matters/>`_
