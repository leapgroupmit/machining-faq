Which direction should the spindle spin? What if itâ€™s going backward?
===============
In most cases, the spindle should spin counter clockwise if you stood at the tailstock and looked at it. This means the top of the spindle should spin toward you, and the bottom should spin away from you. Going the opposite direction can sometimes loosen your part as it turns or promote bad surface finish. To make the spindle spin in the correct direction, push the handle that powers the lathe in, and then push it up.
