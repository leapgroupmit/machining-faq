The lathe is on but my part isn’t spinning– what do I do?

Try playing around with the different dials, fully changing the speed and changing it back. Sometimes the arrows are slightly misleading, and it can be hard to tell if the machine is caught in between two gears. If you feel the handle used to lock in the collet, there should be some resistance when you try to rotate it, as this signals that the gears are meshed.
