Why do I want my tool to be at or a little below center?
==============
Ideally, the tool is perfectly centered, as this will preserve tool life, prevent deflection, and allow cutting to proceed as expected. However, it is better to be slightly below the center than slightly above. Positioning below makes cutting less efficient by reducing the depth of cut, but positioning above could cause more problems by increasing the depth of cut.
