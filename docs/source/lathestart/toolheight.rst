How do I set my tool height? 
============
*How do I know if my tool is at the right height?*

Tool height refers to where the cutting edge of your tool is relative to the center of the part in the vertical direction. To physically adjust the tool height, you can loosen/tighten the nut on the tool holder.

There are many ways to determine the tool height. Two of the most common ways are using a 
center or a ruler. To align a tool with a center, raise/lower the tool so that its cutting 
edge is aligned with a center mounted in the tailstock. To use a ruler, bring your tool in 
against the side of a workpiece until a (thin metal) ruler is loosely held between the tool
and the workpiece. Adjust the tool height until the ruler is perpendicular to the ground. 
Be careful not to press too hard and damage your tool! For a video of these methods 
(and others) in action, check out `this video. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIYEqv8d9vw>`_
