What are the parts of a lathe?
==============
* The **spindle** is the rotating region where you place your part.

* The **tailstock** is a cart at the end of the lathe used to support the workpiece if necessary.

* The **carriage** slides forward and backward and houses the tools that cut the workpiece.

* The **cross slide** is the surface that the carriage slides along.

* The **spindle clutch** manipulates the direction of rotation and state (on/off) of the spindle.
