How do I get the live center or drill chuck out of the tailstock? 
============
*Why won’t the live center or drill chuck stay in place in the tailstock?*

To remove the live center or drill chuck, completely uncrank the tailstock until it’s fully retracted. If it doesn’t automatically pop out, you can use a knockout bar to sharply jab the live center, and it should pop out. If your issue is keeping the live center in place, the hole in your workpiece should be deep enough where the live center snugly fits near the middle or top of the taper. If it is too low or too high, it may not stay in place.
