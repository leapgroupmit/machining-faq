How do I change the speed on a Sharp 1340F lathe?
=============
There are three critical dials that change the speed of the lathe. 

* The small central dial has four orientations: up, down, left, and right. When the handle is vertical, the lathe is in neutral. When the handle points to the right, it narrows down the speed to the two columns on the right. When the handle points to the left, it narrows down the speed to the two columns on the left.

* The larger dial behind the small dial has two arrows near the center. These arrows (which may not coincide with the direction of the handle) narrow down the speed between the two pairs it points to.

* The red dial near the bottom controls whether the speed is in the first column or second column.

Make sure to only change the speed when the machine is **off!**
