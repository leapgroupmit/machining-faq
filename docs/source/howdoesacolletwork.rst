How does a collet work?
=======================

Collets typically have “fingers” and a taper. 
When we squeeze the outside of the collet, these fingers tighten, 
resulting in high static friction and a strong clamping force. 
Different types of machines can use collets. For example, a 
milling machine typically uses a collet to clamp the tool, whereas a 
lathe uses a collet to grip the workpiece.
