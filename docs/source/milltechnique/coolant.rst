Why do we use cutting fluid or coolant?
==========
Cutting fluid and coolant help combat the rapid heating of the end mill or tool due to friction. This preserves the life of the tool by decreasing temperature-induced stresses and strains, facilitating the clearing of chips, and lessening friction.
