What is the difference between speed and feed rate?
===========
Speed is how fast the end mill or workpiece is spinning, typically in inches per minute. Feed rate is how fast the tool and part are moving relative to each other, whether you are moving the tool across the part (for the lathe) or moving the part across the tool (on a mill).
