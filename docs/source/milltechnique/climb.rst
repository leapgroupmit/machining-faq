What is climb milling?
===============

With climb milling, the end mill is moving in the same direction as the feed when it makes contact with the part. 
It is characterized by chips that start thick and grow thinner. Climb milling is preferred on newer machines because
it preserves end mills by reducing the cutting load and has better surface finish, but it should be avoided on older 
mills because it creates backlash. `Read more here. <https://www.cnccookbook.com/climb-milling-versus-conventional-milling/>`_
