What is conventional milling?
============

With conventional milling, the end mill is moving in the opposite direction of the feed when 
it makes contact with the part. Itâ€™s characterized by chips that start thin and get thicker. 
Conventional milling is more typical in older mills that do not correct for backlash, as it 
makes the tool deflect parallel to the cut (which is prefered to perpendicular) at the expense of 
requiring more power, creating more tool wear, and making a rougher finish.
