What is an edge finder?
===========

An edge finder is used to locate the edges of your workpiece and define your XY zero. Many edge finders 
have two or three cylindrical parts that are tensioned together on a spring. The bottom part will wobble 
or kick out to the side when it comes into contact with the workpiece.
