What are good noises? What should milling sound like?
===============================

Good noises on a milling machine are relatively uniform and come from the intersection 
of the tool and the workpiece. They should not hurt your ears or sound squeaky or grumbly
for long periods of time- if this happens, you may want to adjust your speed, feed, 
or depth of cut until you maintain a constant hum.
