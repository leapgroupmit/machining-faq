What is this cyclical sound Iâ€™m hearing?
===========================================

Cyclical sounds result from some sort of **regular, repeating event** involving our cutting tool 
or machine. The frequency of the sound often matches the speed of the spindle (once per revolution)
or the natural frequency of something in our machining set up. Some of the most common cyclical 
sounds occur due to **chatter, interrupted cuts, or dull cutting tools.**

**Chatter** is a `screeching or singing sound <https://youtu.be/LTIEXLE9dH8>`_ that occurs when a machine or workpiece hits its resonant frequency.

**Interrupted cuts** occur when the tool is not in constant contact with the workpiece. 
The repeated impact of the tool on the workpiece creates a repetitive sound. 
To hear different examples of interrupted cuts (non constant contact between the tool 
and the workpiece), `listen here. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gJtrf5Hzts>`_

**Dull blades** may have missing, bent, or dull cutting edges/teeth. 
This makes a sound each time the dull portion passes through the workpiece.
