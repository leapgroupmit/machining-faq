How do I put a vise on the mill?
=============

First, make sure the table is clear of chips. Then, gently place the vise on top of the table and use a 
wrench to tighten **one of the bolts** that fits into the grooves of the table. 

To make sure the vise is straight, place a dial indicator along the edge of the jaw. When you move the table 
left and right in the x direction, the dial indicator should not change. If it does, lightly tap the vise side 
of the vise with a mallet to angle it correctly, and then tighten the second bolt. Read here for a 
`step-by-step approach. <https://youtu.be/6Q_6Kg2Wpb8>`_
