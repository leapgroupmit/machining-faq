Why is my part not sitting flat on the parallels?
==============

There may be chips, grime, or dirt on the vise, parallels, or workpiece that prevent it from laying flat, so make sure that they are clean. It can also be helpful to lightly tap your part with a rubber mallet or dead blow hammer as you tighten the vice. Also, double check to see if the mill is trammed in.
