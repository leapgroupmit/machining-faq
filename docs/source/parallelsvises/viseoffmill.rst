Would I ever take the vise off of the mill?
===============

On most occasions, there is no need to take the vise off the mill. However, you may need to do so to clean it if it gets rusty or clogged with chips. You might also remove the vise to make room to create a fixture for parts that would not easily fit into the vise. Consult a shop staff member before attempting to remove a vise.
