How do I use the clamps?
=======================

Whenever using clamps, be sure to **tighten to something secure!** Most clamps work best on flat surfaces, but some, 
like Kant-twists can also be used on round or irregular surfaces. 
Some clamps, like **C-clamps, F-clamps,** and **Kant-twists,** are **adjustable with a screw.** Twist clockwise to tighten and counterclockwise to loosen.

Other clamps, like **quick-release clamps,** use a tightening trigger and a quick-release lever. 
Pressing the trigger moves the jaws closer together. 
The quick-release lever lets the moveable jaw easily slide.
