How do I clean up?
======================

Itâ€™s a good practice to start cleaning at the top and work your way down! 
Clean chips off of the machine (using a brush, vacuum, or, if standard practice 
in the machine shop, pressurized air), then clean off the lower parts of the machine. 
Sweep the surrounding floor, too. Make sure to throw away chips and return tools/materials 
to their homes!
