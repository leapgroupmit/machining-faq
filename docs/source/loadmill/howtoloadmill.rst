How do I load a tool into the machine?
=============

**First, make sure that the quill is fully upright and locked!** Lightly fit the chuck or collet into the spindle, and hold the “in” button on the mill. Twist the tool around and slightly push up until it catches and lifts into place. 
To remove it, make sure the vise and table underneath the spindle are low, so you don’t accidentally hit your hand. 
Tug on the tool as you press the “out” button, and it should come out. For a demonstration,
