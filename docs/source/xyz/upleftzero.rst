Why is the zero corner most often at the top left-hand side of the workpiece?
=================
The upper left corner provides a standard reference position independent of the depth or width of the piece, because the back of the vice doesn’t move when we switch out parts. This means we have a reliable zero position that we don’t need to reset.
