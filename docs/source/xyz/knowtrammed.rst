How do you determine whether your mill/vice is trammed in?
====================
Remove the vise and attach a dial indicator to the spindle. Bring the table up to the mill so the dial is somewhere between 0.005” and 0.010”, and then zero it. If when you spin the spindle, the indicator does not change, the mill is trammed in.
