How do I read vernier micrometers?
=====================

For vernier micrometers, the **large numbers along the sleeve,** or inner shaft, denote 1/10’s of an inch.
The **smaller lines on the sleeve** represent equal fractions of 1/10”, but how many smaller lines there 
depends on the individual micrometer. For example, if there is one line in between each marked number, 
they each represent an additional 0.005” (one half of 1/10). The number on the thimble, or outer shell, 
is at or closest below the centerline and adds that many thousandths of an inch to the measurement. 
Some micrometers stop there. Others have an additional scale on the sleeve. In that case, whichever 
horizontal line aligns with any line on the thimble provides that many additional ten thousandths of an inch.
