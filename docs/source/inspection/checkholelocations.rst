How do I check hole locations?
=======================

There are two main approaches: one way uses a **surface plate,** and the other uses a **mill.**

To check hole locations with a **surface plate,** you will also need a gage pin, gage block, 
and dial indicator. The goal of this approach is to measure the height of your hole relative to a gage block, 
which has a very precise (and known) height. To learn more about this approach,

To find the center of a hole using a mill, you also use a dial indicator. The goal of this process is to locate 
the center of your hole relative to a reference feature on the part. For a video walkthrough of this process,
