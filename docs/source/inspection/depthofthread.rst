How do I calculate the depth of a thread?
=================================

The **depth of a thread** is the **difference between the major and minor diameters** of a screw. 
Thread depths and diameters are standardized, and these values are available in charts like `this one. <https://www.portlandbolt.com/technical/thread-pitch-chart/>`_

If screw threads were perfect triangles, the depth of thread would be sqrt(3)/2 x the pitch (the 
number of inches between two threads), or about 0.866 x pitch, thanks to the geometry of equilateral 
triangles. However, threads are actually truncated, meaning the top of the triangle is cut off, leaving 
a trapezoidal cross section. As a result, the actual depth of thread is less. A standard full thread 
(100%) is closer to 0.65 x the pitch. 

However, the more the triangle is truncated, the smaller the fraction gets. Some screws are labeled as being 60% or 75% thread, and in this case, the depth would be 0.60 x 0.65 x pitch, or 0.75 x 0.65 x pitch, respectively.
