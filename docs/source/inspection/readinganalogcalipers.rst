How do I read analog calipers?
==============================

**Dial calipers** consist of a ruler-like shaft called a **blade** (also called a **beam** or **bar**) and a **dial** on a **slider.** 
Before measuring, make sure that the calipers fit snugly around the part by tightening the thumbscrew near the 
bottom of the dial – but don’t squeeze too hard! The **thumbscrew** tightens the jaws and extends the depth rod in 
very small increments, ensuring finer precision and making it harder to over-squeeze your part.

You can then read the measurement by **first looking at the blade,** and **then the dial.** Along the blade, there is 
one bold number for every nine fine numbers. The biggest bold number to the left of the dial is the first digit 
in your measurement, and represents how many inches across the feature is. The tenths place is indicated by the 
fine number closest to the left side of the slider. If the pointer does not point to a fine number, but rather a bold one, 
the digit in the tenths place would be 0. Finally, you look at the dial. The dial itself ranges from 0 to 99 and offers 
precision to 1/1000 of an inch, encompassing the hundredths and thousandths places. For example, if the shaft 
reads 0123456789112← and the dial reads 49, the measurement would be 1.249”. 

If you would like to remove the calipers in order to read the measurement, you can do so by **tightening the lock screw** near 
the top of the dial. This keeps the calipers in the same configuration, so you don’t need to worry about the jaws sliding 
out of place.
