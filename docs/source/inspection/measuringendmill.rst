How do I measure an endmill?
====================

The shape of an endmill makes it difficult to measure with calipers. 
However, you can cut a slot into a piece of scrap metal and measure 
the width, which indicates the diameter. You could also hold down the end
mill in a v block and rest a dial indicator on the edge: rotate the end mill to 
see how much the dial undulates along the flute, and then calculate the diameter 
using those measurements.
