What features can I measure with calipers?
===================================

Calipers measure the **physical dimensions of objects.** We often use **digital calipers,** 
which allow us to measure both *external features* (such as the thickness of an object) and 
*internal features* (such as the width of a hole or cavity). Depending on the feature weâ€™re 
trying to measure, we may use different faces/probes of the calipers.
