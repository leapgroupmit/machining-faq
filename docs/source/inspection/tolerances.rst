What are tolerances?
===================

Tolerances are accepted deviations from the intended measurement. No human or machine is perfect, so projects or directions should define what the limits are for permissible variation. Parts that require extreme precision will have small tolerances, whereas projects that are more robust and will still work with larger errors will have larger tolerances.
