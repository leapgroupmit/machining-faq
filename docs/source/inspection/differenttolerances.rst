What measuring equipment should I use for specific tolerances?
===============================

For measuring **longer parts,** a **combination square or ruler** can be a good, quick option. Measurement error is probably
around ±0.10”.

**Calipers** can be used for **many general uses,** where a tolerance of ≥ 0.002” is acceptable, even though they often read out to ±0.0005”. Things like slop in the jaws, abbe error, and measurement repeatability (how hard you “squeeze” the calipers) make the measurement error higher than the readout precision of the calipers.

For **more precise measurements, micrometers** can be a good option as they typically have a tolerance of ±0.0001”.
